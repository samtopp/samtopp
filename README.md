# Welcome to my page!
My name is Sam Topp. I'm a junior studying psychology and science writing from Bethlehem, PA. Outside of class, I'm a member of the Lehigh Smash Club and an associate editor for The Brown & White.
This semester I'm working at the Career Center for work-study and as a Gryphon for Residence Life.
