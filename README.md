## Highest Rated Beer by State
This map shows the highest rated beer by state and the location of the brewery that produces it. The website BeerAdvocate allows users to rate beer based on qualities like smell, taste, visual appearance and overall impression. The beers are given a weighted ranking so that they can be fairly compared to all beer within a given state. Each beer includes its style, alcohol by volume, and availability during the year. A rotating availability means the beer is available at the discretion of each individual brewery.
